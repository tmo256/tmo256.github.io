<!-- =================== SECTION =================== -->          
            <h3 class="target" id="ws-a">Web Standards</h3>

            <p>
            The principles and code fragments within this document assume modern browsers, which includes the latest (desktop and
            mobile) versions of Chrome, Safari and Firefox, as well as IE 11+. Target MS Edge only where your user
            adoption makes it relevant, as Microsoft plans to phase out support for this browser (as of fall 2019, early 2020
            is the estimated release date of MS Edge built on Chromium). Support of other,
            older browser versions may be required where audience usage warrants, which may lead to the need to
            disregard some style guidelines.</p>

            <p>
            Prefer graceful CSS fallbacks to polyfills where possible and employ tools such as <a
            href="https://modernizr.com/">Modernizr</a> to help detect and create these fallback styles. When writing
            JavaScript, use ECMA6 syntax with caution, as some features of the new script version have been
            adopted more widely than others.</p>

            <p>
            If in doubt, <a href="https://caniuse.com/">Can I Use</a> in combination with your audience analytics
            can provide guidance on which front-end features and technologies are reasonable to employ in your application.
            Post-processor tools like <a href="https://postcss.org/">PostCSS</a> can be integrated into automated 
            builds to support next gen CSS functions and prefixed styles (such as prefixed flex rules to support flex in 
            IE 10) to stretch limitations.</p>

            <p>
            In general, prefer:</p>

            <ul class='ul-ui bulleted list'>
              <li class='item'>
                HTML5
              </li>
              <li class='item'>
                CSS3 and new CSS modules with adequate browser adoption.
              </li>
              <li class='item'>
                ECMA5 and ECMA6 features with adequate adoption (or lightweight polyfills).
              </li>
            </ul>

            <div class='divider'></div>

            <h3 class="target" id="int-a">Internationalization (i18n)</h3>

            <p>
            UL is a global company operating in many international markets. Consequently, designers and developers
            should plan for localization, internationalization and translations. If your application has been
            designed responsively, you will most likely be able to accommodate the variations of text length
            resulting from these processes.</p>

            <p>
            For proper text display:</p>

            <ul class='ul-ui bulleted list highlight'>
              <li class='item'>
                add the <code>lang</code> attribute to your root <code>html</code> tag. 
                Prefer <code>html</code> to <code>body</code> to accommodate localized meta tags.
              </li>
              <li class='item'>
                include a meta tag with a <code>charset</code> of UTF-8 or UTF-16, depending on the language you're displaying.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            Without preparation, i18n may affect the display of any HTML element. Look to accommodate for text wrap and horizontal
            overflow. Pay particular attention to:</p>

            <ul class='ul-ui bulleted list'>
                <li class='item'>
                  navigation and menus.
                </li>
                <li class='item'>
                  tab labels.
                </li>
                <li class='item'>
                  button text.
                </li>
                <li class='item'>
                  table column headers.
                </li>
                <li class='item'>
                  any element content with specified heights.
                </li>
            </ul>


            <p>
            In general, assume that text will be longer in German, Spanish and French, and much shorter in Asiatic
            languages.</p>

            <p>
            Also consider ISO formatting in form input fields. Be sure to accommodate a variety of number, date, price,
            zip/province code and telephone formats.</p>

            <div class='divider'></div>

            <h3 class="target" id="ct-a">Common Terminology</h3>

            <p>
            Use common language for common features both within and between different applications.</p>

            <ul class='ul-ui bulleted list highlight'>
                <li class='item'>
                  "Sign in" to refer to the process of authenticating to gain access to the application.
                  (This may necessitate changing existing labels or text from "Log in" and "Login".)
                </li>
                <li class='item'>
                  "Sign out" to refer to removing the authenticated state and leaving the application.
                  (As above, change "Log out," etc.)
                </li>
                <li class='item'>
                  "Account" to refer to user profile settings.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <div class='divider'></div>

            <h3 class="target" id="tp-a">Typography</h3>

            <p>
            UL has standardized the Open Sans font family for web sites and applications. If Open Sans is
            unavailable, use Arial as a substitute. To include Open Sans from the Google Font repository, add this 
            link to your document header:</p>

            <p>
            <code>&lt;link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,600&display=swap" rel="stylesheet"&gt;</code>
            </p>

            <p>
            This example includes the font at 400 (normal) and 600 (semibold) weight. Find out more about this font and
            how to use it at <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans">Google Fonts</a>.</p>

            <p>
            In order to create a visual hierarchy and provide visual contrast and rest for the eyes, use Segoe and
            Helvetica Neue as the base body copy; these fonts will be available on the vast majority of operating
            systems and offer a variety of font weights and variants.</p>

            <p>
            <span class="highlight">For accessibility, set body font size to 100%, which respects individual users'
              text preferences.</span> Browsers typically default font size to 16 pixels; when your body copy is set to 100%, 
            <code>1rem = 16px</code>. If your design calls for 14px type as the base, you can specify individual elements 
            (or "*") to <code>.875rem</code>. The majority of users will experience the site as envisaged. However, users
            who have set their default browser font size to 20px will have their preferences respected; those users
            will still see a larger font size, as .875 of 20 displays 17.5px.</p>

            <p>
            The typography specifics below are based on the concept of typographic modular ratios. The CSS
            example was created using the Major Third scale (which is similar to the UL marketing typography).
            NOTE: For more information on the concept of a typographic modular scale, see
            <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/more-meaningful-typography/">More Meaningful Typography</a>.
            For the scale calculator, see <a href="https://type-scale.com">type-scale.com</a>.</p>

            <p>
            Note: Header font sizes are listed in <code>rems</code> to avoid unintended outcomes in nested elements, 
            while <code>.small</code> is defined in <code>ems</code> in order to display relative to the size of the parent
            element. Carefully consider context and unintended consequences of nested elements when
            defining styles in ems and rems.</p>

            <div class='divider'></div>

            <h3 class="target" id="co-a">Colors</h3>

            <p>
            UL's primary brand colors are as follows:</p>

            <ul class='ul-ui bulleted list'>
                <li class='item'>
                  UL Red: #C02032
                </li>
                <li class='item'>
                  UL Black: #000000
                </li>
                <li class='item'>
                  UL White: #FFFFFF
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            These colors should be preferred as described in the Common Foundation section. Other approved UL
            colors can be found on the <a href="https://hub.ul.com">brandhub</a> site maintained by the corporate marketing team.</p>

<!-- =================== SECTION =================== -->
            <div class='divider'></div>

            <h5 class="target" id="ca-a">Accessibility</h5>

            <p>
            In certain circumstances, UL's red brand color can present challenges to users with color blindness. At
            a minimum,</p>

            <ul class='ul-ui bulleted list'>
                <li class='item'>
                    avoid combining red and green text/backgrounds/juxtapositions;
                </li>
                <li class='item'>
                  when using color to convey meaning (such as red text for error messages, green for
                  success, etc.), also use symbols and words to convey that meaning.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            In general, all text should be readable by measuring a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 (as low as 3.0 is
            acceptable in some circumstances, where font weight or text size are sufficiently large)
            between text and background. A number of online contrast checker tools are available; Chrome developer 
            tools also provides a tool to do this (<a
              href="https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/how-to-use-the-contrast-checker-in-chrome-devtools--cms-31504">tutorial</a>).</p>

<!-- =================== SECTION =================== -->
            <div class='divider'></div>

            <h3 class="target" id="ic-a">Icons</h3>

            <p>
            Icons should be used as accents to support the topic and ideas being presented. As noted above, a
            combination of color, text and icons will convey the message best.</p>

            <p>
            <span class="highlight">Use Font Awesome wherever possible for icons. Use the Light version, available to 
              Pro users, when possible.</span></p>

            <p>
            Font Awesome icons can be rendered as vectors at any size and don’t require any extra
            downloads or server resources; the library includes a large number of icons covering a wide gamut of
            objects.</p>

            <p>
            On occasion, you may need to develop custom icons for special cases. Implement these icons in the code
            as SVGs, which allows for smooth and responsive resizing.</p>

<!-- =================== SECTION =================== -->            
            <div class='divider'></div>

            <h3 class="target" id="res-a">Responsiveness</h3>

            <p>
            Sites and web applications should support responsive layouts if at all possible. Using common break points 
            will provide a consistent experience for those that switch between applications on desktop, tablet and mobile
            devices.</p>
      
            <ul class='ul-ui bulleted list'>
              <li class='item'><span class="highlight">576px max – Small</span></li>
              <li class='item'><span class="highlight">768px max – Medium</span></li>
              <li class='item'><span class="highlight">992px max – Large</span></li>
              <li class='item'><span class="highlight">1200px max – Extra large</span></li>
              <li class='item'><span class="highlight">1600px max – Double extra large</span></li>
            </ul>


            <p>
            Prefer fluid layouts to fixed width if the content will support it. When displaying paragraphs 
            of text in fluid layouts, you may need to limit (via media queries) container widths for 
            readability. Conventionally, this will be 34 to 36ems, but use good judgement. See "Components"
            section below for specific responsive-related guidelines.</p>
