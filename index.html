      <p>
      The goal of this document is to facilitate the creation of a common UI / UX experience for all UL external-facing
      web applications; it provides a set of guidelines that can be applied to both existing and new applications and
      features. This document is not intended to be comprehensive, nor does it aspire to answer every possible question
      that might arise during application development. Designers and developers are encouraged to apply common sense 
      and good judgement while applying guidelines outlined here!</p>

      <p>
      By providing goals, citation and context wherever possible, this document seeks to explain the reasoning behind each
      suggested rule, which by extension should also help application producers understand when and why to disregard them.
      <span class="highlight">However, designers and developers should generally adhere to highlighted items 
        absent strong reasons to disregard.</span></p>

        <h5>Note on Creation</h5>
      This document was originally created in the summer of 2019  as part of a common architecture project composed of UL's 
      commercial business units.  The intention of the project was to create a set of shared components including Identity 
      Management, API Management, and common look and feel, so that customer facing applications developed across UL would 
      present a similar experience for UL's customers.</aside>
