            HTML5 provides srcset, an attribute designed to deliver the optimal file for the viewport size of each
            specific device requesting an image. When specified, the browser determines the smallest (file size)
            image to download based on its resolution and element’s dimensions.

        <p>
            When displaying images, it’s important to remember the largest version should be formatted for viewing
            across all viewport sizes. To ensure proper display, give the image a max-width property of 100%.
            However, in some instances, including the max-width may not be enough. While it is always important to
            test views in multiple browser sizes, images may require more specific adjustments to responsive layouts
            than any other page element. In many frameworks, layout becomes liquid at specific viewport sizes (i.e.
            at 768px all sizing is based on percentage rather than specific pixel sizes). With a broad variety of
            sizes for small touch devices, be sure to test images thoroughly. </p>

        <h3 class="target" id="sr-a">Image Sizing and Resolution</h3>
        <p>
            Images should display at the correct resolution for all types of screen resolutions. Historically,
            images delivered to screens have required resolution of no more than 72ppi. However, with the advent of
            Retina and other high-resolution screens, resolutions have increased to 144+ppi. Unfortunately, most web
            file formats can only be saved as 72ppi and do not display crisply on high resolution screens in their
            native size.
        </p>

        <p>
            To address this problem, you will need to create at least one version of the image at twice the maximum
            size it will appear within the site, and then use CSS styling to adjust dimensions to half its native
            size. For instance, if you have an image that needs to be displayed at 100×50, then you should save the
            image at 200×100 and use height and width properties in display.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is important to recognize that the largest display of an image size may not correspond to the largest
            media screen size. This means that an image may actually display larger in mobile or tablet view than in
            desktop, depending on the page layout at each responsive break. Again, responsive testing is vital in
            ensuring the image displays crisply and responsively in all formats.
        </p>
        <p>Using <code>srcset</code> to deliver responsive images means you should determine the
                largest display size as outlined above, and then make smaller versions of this image as well. Use
                the devices your analytics indicate to determine your target sizes or use an online tool, such as
                the <a href="https://www.responsivebreakpoints.com/">Responsive Image Breakpoints
                    Generator</a>, to create a subset of images.</p>

        <aside>
          <h4>One caveat</h4>

          <p>
          As with any guideline, use your discretion to determine when
          an image filesize is small enough for delivery to all
          devices. Your audience statistics and application context may mean that
          files of less than 10k or even 25k are perfectly acceptable for
          delivery across all devices. Consider the total weight of
          the page as well as the other technicalities.</p>

        <h3 class="target" id="ff-a">Image File Formats</h3>
        <p>
            Because of high resolution proliferation, PNG formats will best serve as web collateral. Consider
            indexed or 8-bit PNG format for illustrative images, rather than the full 24-bit resolution. Much like
            indexed GIF images, this lower bit-per-pixel display will have a considerably smaller file size. Larger
            photographic images will be better saved as JPGs to reduce delivery size. As noted below, always use a
            tool to optimize these images for maximum compression, as client-side auditors will penalize even the
            most diligently saved file.
        </p>
        <p><span>Save vector graphics as native SVG files. For instance, your application logo, which may use a
                custom font and be displayed in a variety of sizes and colors, could be implemented as an SVG image.
                If you believe an image may be suited for this type of display, also consider the cons, including
                rendering time and processing. The object implementation of SVG files with external CSS is the
                optimal implementation. For more information, see </span><a

        <h3 class="target" id="opt-a">Image Optimization</h3>
        <p>
            As noted above, non-optimized, uncompressed images can be quite large in terms of file size and this can
            have an outsize effect in high network latency situations like cellular networks for mobile devices or
            even just browsers that are a long way from your data center. I.e. in China.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is critical to use proper tools and techniques to fully optimize image formats to reduce file size
            and then at as high a rate of lossy compression as is tolerable while still maintaining required image
            quality. While it is possible to accomplish a good file size optimization in your image editor, there
            are many freely available tools on the web that make this easy; again, even highly optimized images may
            trip a penalty from auditing tools. Online image processors for optimization include:
        </p>

          <li class='item'>
            Optimizilla <a href="https://imagecompressor.com">Image Compressor</a> makes fine-tuning images 
            exceptionally easy.

          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        There are also ways to integrate image compression and optimization in version control systems so that
        it happens automatically on any new image that is introduced to the repo. Cloudflare also provides a
        solution for optimizing image delivery.</p>
