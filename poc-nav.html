        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
        The goal of this document is to facilitate the creation of a common UI / UX experience 
        for all UL external-facing web applications; it provides a set of common rules that can be 
        applied to all existing and new applications and features. It is not intended to be comprehensive
        or to answer every possible question that might arise in developing an application. Designers and devs 
        are encouraged to apply common sense and good judgement!</p>

        <p>
        By providing goals, citation and context wherever possible, this document seeks to explain the 
        reasoning behind each suggested rule, which by extension should help application producers understand when 
        and why to disregard them. However, items that are highlighted in teal should generally be
        adhered to unless there are very strong reasons to disregard.</p>

        <p>
        This document is intended to be technology agnostic and provide common guidelines whether the underlying 
        implementation is SASS or LESS, Bootstrap or Semantic UI, React or Angular, etc.</p>

        <h2>Common Foundation</h2>

        <p>
        Implementing the common foundation in an application will accomplish 80% of a common look and should
        (and is intended to) be able to be accomplished quickly.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Header color and UL logo. UL red header is preferred but for historical /
              persona reasons other choices are acceptable- Good Guide, for example, serves an entirely 
              different persona from what is more typical for other UL apps.</li>
          <li>Footer color. Dark grey, common link styles and elements (copyright, etc.) where possible.</li>
          <li>Font: Adopt Open Sans for headers at minimum.</li>
          <li>Icons: font awesome (there is some cost associated with this).</li>
          <li>Button styles: Padding / border radius, shape, border, shadow, mouseovers (transitions, relative 
              lightness/brightness). Not necessary, color or typography.</li>
        </ul>
