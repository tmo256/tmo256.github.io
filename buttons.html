        <h1 class="ul-ui dividing header">Anchors &amp; Buttons
            <div class="sub header">The guidelines below describe usage and styling of button and anchor elements. See
                “Forms” for specific uses within the context of a form.
            </div>
        </h1>
        <h3>Buttons: Coding</h3>
        <p>
            Use a button element to trigger any JavaScript function that does not use a URL. Basically, instead of using
            an a tag with an href="Javascript:void(0)", or href="#", use a button element. If the user can open a
            reference via a right-click or 3D touch, use an anchor.
        </p>
        <p>This might include</p>
        <div class="ul-ui bulleted list">
            <div class="item">non-AJAX modal triggers.</div>
            <div class="item">popover triggers.</div>
            <div class="item">tooltip elements.</div>
            <div class="item">dismissing buttons in modals and alerts.</div>
            <div class="item">opening and closing/expanding hidden text.</div>
        </div>
        <p>In many of the cases (such as some listed above), the button may appear to the user to be an inline link. Use
            CSS to modify the button to look like a link.</p>
        <div class="ul-ui alert">
            <p>Always use the type="button" attribute-value to ensure a button does not inadvertently act as a form
                submit. Safari, Chrome and other browsers treat button elements as submit tags when nested in forms.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Buttons: Styling</h3>
        <p>
            As noted, button elements may be styled to appear as either buttons or as links, depending on their
            conceptual use.
        </p>
        <p>
            Style elements as a button when:
        </p>
        <div class="ul-ui bulleted list">
            <div class="item">indicating persistence or as a step in a process leading to persistence. This includes
                actions such as save, save and move forward or back (“next” and “previous” step), submit, delete,
                update.</div>
            <div class="item">creating call to action (CTA). The number of CTAs should be limited on a view and
                should strongly indicate to the user what their next action should be.</div>
        </div>
        <p>Unless noted elsewhere in this document, style the button as a link in most other situations.</p>
        <br>
        <button class="ul-ui button">
            As button
        </button>
        <div class="ul-ui button" tabindex="0">
            As Div
        </div>
        <a href="#" class="ul-ui button">As an a tag</a>
        <a href="#">a text link</a>

        <h3>Buttons: Responsiveness</h3>
        <p>In most circumstances, elements styled as buttons should become block elements in medium and smaller
            viewports in order to accommodate touch behavior; the exception to this rule might be for “Next” and
            “Previous” buttons. Be sure to create adequate spacing and padding to allow all users to use your
            buttons on a touchscreen.</p>
        <br>
        <button class="xxsm ul-ui button">
            XXSmall
        </button>
        <button class="xsm ul-ui button">
            Xsmall
        </button>
        <button class="small ul-ui button">
            Small
        </button>
        <button class="base ul-ui button">
            Base
        </button>
        <button class="medium ul-ui button">
            Medium
        </button>
        <button class="large ul-ui button">
            Large
        </button>
        <button class="fluid ul-ui button">Fits container</button>

        <h3>Buttons: Usability</h3>
        <div class="ul-ui bulleted list">
            <div class="item">
                <p>Use sentence case for button labels.</p>
                <button class="ul-ui button">This is a Button with Sentence Case</button>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <p>Limit characters. Button text should be as short as possible with action words that
                    clearly explain what the button does (Create Account, Save, Search).</p>
                <button class="ul-ui button">Create Account</button>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <p>
                    Be consistent in this terminology across the application, such as “Save” vs
                    “Submit”.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <p>Lead with a verb where possible. For example, “Create Account” not “Account Creation”.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <p>Icons can also be helpful. At times, consider adding an icon to signal specific actions (Download,
                    Open in a new window, etc.).</p>
                <button class="ul-ui icon red button">
                    <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle icon" aria-hidden="true"></i>
                    Warning
                </button>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <p>
                    Use consistent class variations to distinguish types and convey meaning. For
                    example, “Previous” button steps should use a default or plain button
                    class, while a submit or CTA button would implement a special primary.
                </p>
                <button class="ul-ui button">Previous</button>
                <button class="ul-ui teal button">Next</button>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Anchors: Coding</h3>
        <p>Whenever an element uses a URL or in-page navigation, use an anchor tag. This includes:</p>
        <div class="ul-ui bulleted list">
            <div class="item">
                <p>standard inline links.</p>
                <p>I am a <a href="#">standard inline link</a> in the grand scheme of things.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <p>
                    jump nav links (href=#element-id).
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <p>
                    AJAX modal triggers, where the user can also open content in a new tab (by right-click or 3D touch).
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <p>
                    all cases described in “Forms”.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                when in doubt, prefer an anchor tag.
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            As noted above, a trigger for a modal may appear either as a link or a button, depending
            on circumstances. If the request is made using the URL in the href attribute, use an
            anchor.
        </p>
        <div class="ul-ui alert">
            <p>
                When using an anchor tag as a button, include the role="button" attribute.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Anchors: Styling</h3>
        <p>
            Inline anchor style should use standard body font family and size, line height, etc,
            and, by default, an underline (text-decoration) to indicate a link to the user. This
            allows the designer to use colored text as a design element in headers or banners
            without creating confusion for the user; users should be able to identify links by more
            than color alone.</p>
        <p>
            In some cases, the context of the link will provide the user with the indication of
            clickability; for instance, within a standard navigation in the header, or within a
            drop-down submenu. In those cases, underlines or other indicators may not be required.</p>

        <p>Where an interactive link reveals (expands or creates) text, include an indicator of
            further content, such as an angle or caret icon. Ideally, this indicator would change
            orientation (animated) to indicate open and closed.</p>

        <p>When designing for touch display, make sure to provide adequate space around every link,
            just as with buttons. Pay specific attention to lists and menus.
        </p>
        <p>This is just <a href="#">a random link</a> in the grand scheme of things.</p>
        <p><a class="block" href="#">This is some linked block of text.</a></p>
        <p><a href="#">Here are a few</a> <a href="#">linked text items</a> <a href="#">in a row.</a>
        </p>
        <h3>Input Submits</h3>
        <p>
            Use styling described in the “Buttons: Styling” and “Buttons: Usability” sections.
        </p>
        <p>
            Where possible, submit a form using input type="submit".
        </p>
        <p>
            As noted in “Forms”, attach any validation or pre-processing to the submit event for
            forms rather than click events on these elements. This will enable the use of the submit
            button, as well as ensure that submission by using the “Return” key or by assistive
            technology software will always execute the required JavaScript.
        </p>
        <h3>Other Cases</h3>
        <p>
            n addition to the cases noted above (primarily buttons that trigger JavaScript functions), buttons may be
            styled as links or vice versa.
        </p>
        <div class="ul-ui bulleted list">
            <div class="item">
                <p>
                    All elements in an “Action” table cell should appear to the user to be links. The actions may be a
                    mix of regular anchor tags, such as an anchor link to “Edit;” buttons, such as a confirmation modal
                    triggered for a delete; or a submit button, as when submitting a form to make a saved search an
                    alert.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <p>
                        Regular anchors may be styled as buttons for an extraordinary or analogous call to action, such as
                        “Registration” links.
                </p>>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <p>
                        Where a mix of form submit and anchor elements should be viewed as siblings of equal
                        importance, be consistent in displaying each element as either buttons or links.
                </p>
