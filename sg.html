      <h1>Style Guide</h1>

        <h2>Web Standards</h2>

        <p>
        The principles and code fragments below assume modern browsers, which includes the latest (desktop and 
        mobile) versions of Chrome, Safari and Firefox, as well as IE 11+. Target MS Edge only 
        where your user adoption makes it relevant, as Microsoft plans to phase out support for this browser. 
        Support of other, older browser versions may be required where audience usage warrants, which may
        lead to the need to disregard some style guidelines.</p>

        <p>
        Prefer graceful CSS fallbacks to polyfills where possible and employ tools such as Modernizr to help
        detect and create these fallback styles. When writing JavaScript, use ECMA6 syntax with caution, as some 
        features of the new script version have been adopted more widely than others.</p>

        <p>
        If in doubt, Can I Use in combination with your audience analytics can provide guidance on what 
        browser features are reasonable to employ for your application. Post-processor tools like PostCSS
        can be integrated into automated builds to support next gen CSS functions and prefixed styles 
        (such as prefixed flex rules to support flex in IE 10) to stretch limitations.</p>

        <h2>Colors</h2>

        <p>
        UL's primary brand colors are as follows:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>UL Red: #C02032</li>
          <li>UL Black: #000000</li>
          <li>UL White: #FFFFFF</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        These colors should be preferred as described in the Common Foundation section. Other approved UL
        colors can be found on the brandhub site maintained by the corporate marketing team.</p>

        <h3>Accessibility</h3>

        <p>
        Note, in certain circumstances ULâ€™s red brand color can present challenges to users with color blindness. 
        At a minimum,</p>

        <ul>
          <li>avoid combining red and green text/backgrounds/juxtapositions;</li>
          <li>when using color to convey meaning (such as red text for error messages, green for success,
            etc.), also use symbols and words to convey that meaning.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        In general, all text should be readable by measuring a contrast ratio of at least 4.5 
        (as low as 3.0 is acceptable in some circumstances) between text and background. A number 
        of contrast checker online tools are available; Chrome developer tools also provides a tool to do this (tutorial).</p>
