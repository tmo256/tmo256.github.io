          <h1 class="ul-ui dividing header">Forms</h1>
          <h3 class="target" id="int-a">Input types</h3>
          <p>
              Where appropriate, use HTML5 input types to ensure ease of use on touch devices. This includes, but is
              not limited to:
          </p>
          <ul class='ul-ui bulleted list'>
              <li class='item'>email</li>
              <li class='item'>range</li>
              <li class='item'>search</li>
              <li class='item'>tel*</li>
              <li class='item'>url</li>
          </ul>
          <div class='ul-ui alert'>*Note: On mobile devices, tel type puts the user into the number keypad rather than
              the regular keyboard. Use tel as the preferred type when coding a numbers-only input.
          </div>
          <p>
              Do not use the following types, as the implementation in some (or all) browsers may be confusing
              ("number" input, for example) or plugins implement the feature:
          </p>
          <ul class='ul-ui bulleted list'>
              <li class='item'>number</li>
              <li class='item'>month</li>
              <li class='item'>color</li>
              <li class='item'>date</li>
              <li class='item'>datetime</li>
              <li class='item'>datetime-local</li>
              <li class='item'>time</li>
              <li class='item'>week</li>
          </ul>


        <!-- =================== SECTION =================== -->
        <div class='divider'></div>

        <h3 class="target" id="is-a">Input / Submits</h3>

        <p>
        Use styling described in the "Buttons: Styling" and "Buttons: Usability" sections.</p>

        <ul class='ul-ui bulleted list'>
          <li class='item'>
            <span class="highlight">Where possible, submit a form using input type="submit".</span>
          </li>
          <li class='item'>
            As noted in "Javascript Validations", attach any validation or pre-processing to the
            submit event for forms rather than click events on these elements. This will enable 
            the use of the submit button, as well as ensure that submission by using the "Return" 
            key or by assistive technology software will always execute the required JavaScript.
          </li>
        </ul>

            <!-- =================== SECTION =================== -->
            <div class='divider'></div>
            <h3 class="target" id="bl-a">Buttons and Links</h3>
            <p>
                Forms commonly require actions other than a simple submit. In some cases, these actions should be
                performed by buttons and sometimes by links.
            </p>

            <p>
                Note that although the rules below refer to buttons and links, the elements need not specifically be
                input, button or anchor tags; rather, we refer to the styling of the element (see "Anchors and Buttons"
                for more information on how to style these elements). For the vast majority of instances in the context
                of forms, however, links should be anchor tags and submit buttons input elements of type "submit" (see
                "Anchors and Buttons" for details on when to use each type of element).
            </p>

            <p>
                Use the general guideline of the necessity of a URL to differentiate between using an anchor or a
                button.
            </p>

            <b>Buttons</b>
            <ul class='ul-ui bulleted list'>
                <li class='item'> Submit (Create/Update) </li>
                <li class='item'> Delete </li>
                <li class='item'> Reset * </li>
                <li class='item'> Any action that initiates a data transaction </li>
            </ul>

            <b>Links</b>
            <ul class='ul-ui bulleted list'>
                <li class='item'><p>
                    Cancel *
                </p></li>
                <li class='item'><p>
                    Forgot Password
                </p></li>
                <li class='item'><p>
                    Actions within tables (e.g. "Remove" link in a list, which performs a form submit) * Note this represents a case where the element appears to the user to be a link but should actually be a button.
                </p></li>
                <li class='item'><p>
                    Any other action that does not initiate a data transaction
                </p></li>
            </ul>

            <div class='ul-ui alert'>
                <p>
                    Actions within tables (e.g. "Remove" link in a list, which performs a form submit)* . Note this
                    represents a case where the element appears to the user to be a link but should actually be a button.
                </p>
            </div>


            <!-- =================== SECTION =================== -->
            <div class='divider'></div>
            <h3 class="target" id="se-a"> Submit Events</h3>
            <p>
                As discussed above, although buttons and links do not necessarily need to correspond to their native
                HTML element tags, forms should generally be executed with input elements of type "submit." Use a submit
                input instead of input of type="button". (See "Anchors and Buttons" for more information on when to use
                alternative element types.)
            </p>

            <p>
                Any JavaScript in need of execution upon form submission should be attached to the formâ€™s submit event,
                rather than attached to a click event of a button or link. Additionally, users will be able to submit
                forms by using the "Return/Enter" key, within a touch device keyboard, or by other methods (especially
                those used by accessibility browsers); attaching events to form submits circumvents all these issues.
            </p>


            <!-- =================== SECTION =================== -->
            <div class='divider'></div>
            <h3 class="target" id="jv-a">JavaScript Validations</h3>
            <p>
                In most cases, JavaScript validations are not necessary. Some situations may make client-side validation
                more useful to the user, however.
            </p>

            <p>
                Use client-side validations when:
            </p>
            <ul class='ul-ui bulleted list'>
                <li class='item'><p>the form is submitted via AJAX. Generally, this will make action flow more fluidly for
                the user.</p></li>
                <li class='item'><p>the form contains a file upload input. Because of security issues, uploaded files are
                detached on page load, which makes round-trip validation poor UX (as the user is forced to reattach
                the file).
                (Note that some browsers expose more attributes of uploaded files than others, making specific
                validations relating to file size, type, etc., inconsistent across browsers.)</p></li>
                <li class='item'><p>
                    the form contains typeahead inputs that might be lost upon reload.
                </p></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Best Practices</p>
            <ul class='ul-ui bulleted list'>
                <li class='item'>
                    <p>Implement the same error styling to the elements as the user would see from a
                        server-side validation.</p>
                </li>
                <li class='item'>
                    <p>Validate on form on submit rather than on input. However, a multistep input, such as
                        typeahead field, may be validated on value select for better interaction flow.</p>
                </li>
                <li class='item'>
                    <p>Clear errors on re-validation. Depending on the input type, as in the case of password
                        field, clearing the error on field change may be more helpful to the user.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>


            <!-- =================== SECTION =================== -->
            <div class='divider'></div>
            <h3 class="target" id="seh-a">Success &amp; Error Handling</h3>
            <p>
                As described in the "Alert" section, indicate success by including a visual alert in the resulting view.
                This alert should be dismissible (it is not necessary to programmatically close the alert after a set
                period of time).
            </p>

            <p>
                When a view includes a form with error fields, an alert should be visible at the top of the view with a
                generic error message, such as "Please correct the input errors." Do not list individual field errors in
                this message. Specify these errors by styling each invalid input.
            </p>
