          </h5>

          <p>
          In general, consider the following when creating forms:</p>

          <ul class='ul-ui bulleted list'>
            <li class="item">
              As with all elements, practice accessible coding techniques with form fields, fieldsets and buttons. 
            </li>
            <li class="item">
              Touch device behavior and display of inputs will impact your form, so consider your audience usage when
              designing. Mobile browsers may default to capitals, zoom unexpectedly, implement special field types
              differently and employ different fonts, among other considerations. Think about including attributes like
              <code>autocapitalize</code>, which only impacts virtual keyboards and voice-to-text input.
            </li>
            <li class="item">
              In some browsers, autocompletion of information, whether from past input or saved personal data, may
              affect field completion and validation. Consider field names and input attributes for each form field.
              For instance, you will likely suppress capitalization, spellcheck and autocomplete on search and 
              typeahead search fields, but may wish to encourage <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete">autocompletion</a> 
              for contact information of the user's name and address.
            </li>
          </ul>
          

          <p>
          Where appropriate, use HTML5 input types to ensure ease of use, particularly on touch devices. The <code>email</code>
          input type is especially useful in mobile browsers, but all types to consider include:</p>

          <ul class='ul-ui bulleted list'>
            <li class='item'><code>email</code></li>
            <li class='item'><code>range</code></li>
            <li class='item'><code>search</code></li>
            <li class='item'><code>tel*</code></li>
            <li class='item'><code>url</code></li>
          </ul>

          <aside class='ul-ui alert'>*Note: On mobile devices, tel type puts the user into the number keypad rather than
              the regular keyboard. Use tel as the preferred type when coding a numbers-only input.
          </aside>

          <p>
          Use the following types with caution, as the implementation in some (or all) browsers may be confusing
          and vary dramatically in presentation:</p>

          <ul class='ul-ui bulleted list'>
            <li class='item'><code>month</code></li>
            <li class='item'><code>color</code></li>
            <li class='item'><code>date</code></li>
            <li class='item'><code>datetime</code></li>
            <li class='item'><code>datetime-local</code></li>
            <li class='item'><code>time</code></li>
            <li class='item'><code>week</code></li>
          </ul>

          <aside>
            All major browsers support the <code>number</code> input,
            but display may vary. Because several browsers
            include some kind of spinner UI (up/down arrows to
            increment the input), some users may be confused by the type of field, 
              while others are familiar with it. To mitigate this
                problem, you can <a
              href="https://css-tricks.com/numeric-inputs-a-comparison-of-browser-defaults/">use
              input attributes and browser-specific styling</a> in your implementation, or
            consider an alternate input, such as <code>tel</code>.

            As noted in "Javascript Validations", attach any validation or pre-processing to the

            the use of the submit button, as well as ensure that submission by using the "Return" 
            key or by assistive technology software will always execute the required JavaScript.

        <!-- =================== SECTION =================== -->
        <div class='divider'></div>
        <h3 class="target" id="bl-a">Buttons and Anchors, Part II</h3>

        <p>
        Forms commonly require actions other than a simple submit. In some cases, these actions should be
        performed by buttons and in others, by links. Again, note that when we refer to buttons and links,
        the elements need not specifically be <code>input</code>, <code>button</code> or <code>a</code> tags; 
        rather, we refer to the styling of the element (see "Anchors and Buttons"
        for more information on how to style). (Use the general guideline of the necessity of a URL to 
        differentiate between using an anchor or a button. Can the user right-click or 3d touch on the link and open in a new
        window?)</p>

        <b>Buttons</b>
        <ul class='ul-ui bulleted list'>
            <li class='item'> Submit (Create/Update) </li>
            <li class='item'> Delete </li>
            <li class='item'> Reset </li>
            <li class='item'> Any action that initiates a data transaction </li>
        </ul>

        <b>Links</b>
        <ul class='ul-ui bulleted list'>
            <li class='item'> Cancel </li>
            <li class='item'> Forgot Password </li>
            <li class='item'> Actions within tables (e.g. "Remove" link in a list, which performs a form submit)</li>
            <li class='item'>
                Any other action that does not initiate a data transaction (but rather navigates to a different resource).
            </li>
        </ul>


        <!-- =================== SECTION =================== -->
        <div class='divider'></div>

        <h3 class="target" id="se-a"> Submit Events</h3>

        <p>
        As discussed above, although buttons and links do not necessarily need to correspond to their native
        HTML element tags, forms should generally be executed with input elements of <code>type="submit"</code>. Use this
        tag rather than <code>&lt;input type="button"&gt;</code>.</p>

        <p>
        Attach all JavaScript triggers to form and field events, however, rather than click events of a button or link.
        The allows users to submit forms or tab through form fields with keys, within a touch device keyboard,
        or by other methods (especially those used by accessibility browsers); attaching events to form submits 
        circumvents problems that may arise from any alternate input scenario.</p>


        <!-- =================== SECTION =================== -->
        <div class='divider'></div>

        <h3 class="target" id="jv-a">JavaScript Validations</h3>

        <p>
        In most cases, JavaScript validations are not necessary. Some situations may make client-side validation
        more useful to the user, however.</p>

        <p>
        You may potentially want to use client-side validations when:</p>

        <ul class='ul-ui bulleted list'>
            <li class='item'>
              the form is submitted via AJAX. Generally, this will make action flow more fluidly for
              the user.
            </li>
            <li class='item'>
              the form contains a file upload input. Because of security issues, uploaded files are
              detached on page load, which makes round-trip validation poor UX (as the user is forced to reattach
              the file).
              (Note that some browsers expose more attributes of uploaded files than others, making specific
              validations relating to file size, type, etc., inconsistent across browsers.)</li>
            <li class='item'>
              the form contains typeahead inputs that might be lost upon reload.
            </li>
            <li class='item'>
              moving from page to page in some kind of creation
              Wizard. Whether this pattern applies may depend on how
              the Wizard is implemented and dependencies between input
              fields from page to page.
            </li>
            <li class="item">
              looking for specific patterns on fields such passwords,
              where the text is obscured from view.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        While client-side validation is often an expedient and helpful pattern, consider certain drawbacks:</p>

        <ul class="ul-ui bulleted list">
          <li class="item">
            Because resources may be much slower to load in mobile
            devices, users may begin filling out forms before
            JavaScript is applied to the form, leading to uncertain
            execution.
          </li>
          <li class="item">
            Is the validation executed on submit or on field change?
            Users commonly skip or half-complete fields for many
            reasons while filling out a form, and pre-emptive errors
            can lead to frustration for the user.
          </li>
          <li class="item">
            Browser autocomplete may act in unexpected ways, resulting
            in a false test outcomes.
          </li>
          <li class="item">
            If a form is long (or a viewport too small), inputs may be
            out of view on form submit, requiring a scripting
            solution.
          </li>
          <li class="item">
            As always, consider how JavaScript will interact with assistive technology
            devices and software; ensure the user gets a clear idea of
            what is happening by employing alert dialogs as described
            by WAI-ARIA best practices.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Best Practices</h5>

        <ul class='ul-ui bulleted list'>
          <li class="item">
            Do not put the user in "double-jeopardy" if at all avoidable. This means the user should rarely see
            a second set of errors after satisfying errors shown before form submit.
          </li>
          <li class='item'>
            To avoid the above scenario, validate on form on submit rather than on input. However, a multistep input, such as
            typeahead field or password confirmation, may be validated on change for better interaction flow.
          </li>
          <li class='item'>
            Implement the same error styling to the elements as the user would see from a server-side validation.
          </li>
          <li class='item'>
            Clear errors on re-validation. Depending on the input type, as in the case of password
            field, it may be possible that clearing the error on field change may be more helpful to the user.
          </li>
        </ul>


        <!-- =================== SECTION =================== -->
        <div class='divider'></div>

        <h3 class="target" id="seh-a">Success &amp; Error Handling</h3>

        <p>
        As described in the "Alerts" section, indicate success by including a visual alert in the resulting view.
        This alert can be dismissible, though it is not necessary to programmatically close the alert after a set
        period of time.</p>

        <p>
        When a view does include a form with error fields, an alert should be visible at the top of the view with a
        generic error message, such as "Please correct the input errors." Do not list individual field errors in
        this message. Specify these errors by styling each invalid input.</p>

        <p>
        As always, consistent with the placement and styling of these
        types of messages. Use a combination of text, color and
        iconography to convey the message to the user.</p>
